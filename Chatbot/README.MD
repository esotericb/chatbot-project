# Customer Service Chatbot for Water Utility Company

This project is an intelligent customer service chatbot designed to assist customers of a water utility company. The chatbot is capable of handling customer queries related to billing, payments, water services, and more. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a pre-trained BERT model for question-answering, a knowledge base, and context management to provide intelligent and personalized responses.

## Key Components:

- **Flask Application**: The chatbot is built upon the Flask web framework, providing a flexible foundation for building web applications.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine**: This core component utilizes NLP techniques to understand the user's intent from their queries.
- **BERT Model Integration**: The project incorporates a pre-trained BERT model, enhancing the NLP engine's ability to handle complex language and improve understanding.
- **Intent Classification**: The intent_classifier.py module utilizes scikit-learn to classify user queries into predefined intents, allowing the chatbot to respond appropriately.
- **Interaction Logging**: User interactions are logged to analyze user behavior and improve the chatbot's performance over time.
- **Database Models**: The models.py file defines database models to store user preferences and chatbot interaction data.
- **Intents Definition (intents.json)**: This file specifies user intents, along with corresponding patterns and responses, guiding the chatbot's behavior.
- **Front-end Interface**: The templates/index.html file provides the visual interface for users to interact with the chatbot.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-water-utility.git
   cd chatbot-water-utility
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install Dependencies:** 
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up the Database:
a. Install MySQL and create a database named water_utility_db.
b. Update database configuration in app/__init__.py.
c. Run the migrations to set up the tables:
flask db upgrade
5. **Run the Application:** python app/main.py


## Usage
1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
2. Interact with the chatbot by asking questions related to billing, payments, water quality, etc.
3. The chatbot will classify your query, look up the knowledge base, and respond intelligently.


## Memory Storage
1. The chatbot uses an in-memory dictionary to store user-specific preferences during a session.
2. For persistent storage, it uses a MySQL database to store user interactions and preferences.

## Context Management
1. The chatbot maintains context using a global context dictionary to handle multi-turn conversations.
2. It tracks the userâ€™s last intent and adjusts responses accordingly.

## Pre-trained Model Integration
1. The chatbot integrates a pre-trained BERT model using the Hugging Face Transformers library for question-answering tasks.
2. To change or fine-tune the model, modify app/nlp_transformers.py.

## Known Issues
1. The chatbot's intelligence is limited by the patterns and training data provided in intents.json.
2. Context management is session-based and does not persist across multiple user sessions.
3. Pre-trained model responses may be too generic if not fine-tuned for the water utility domain.


## Future Enhancements
1. **Fine-tune BERT Model:** Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on a domain-specific dataset to improve its accuracy.
2. **User Authentication:** Integrate user authentication to provide personalized experiences across sessions.
3. **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a feedback loop for users to rate responses, allowing iterative improvements to the model.
4. **Synonym Recognition:** Use word embeddings or a synonym dictionary to handle query variations more effectively.
5. **API Integration:** Connect to external APIs (e.g., billing systems) for real-time information retrieval.
